description: Guidance for writing multiplayer game code in Genesys. Use when implementing networked features, RPCs, replicated actors or properties, server-authoritative logic, game mode lifecycle, player spawning in multiplayer, or when the user mentions multiplayer, networking, server, client, replication, RPC, latency, or authority.
---

# Methodology

Follow these steps when working on multiplayer features:

1. Determine where the code must run — server, client, or both — before writing anything. Consult [server-authority](references/server-authority.md) to understand NetRuntime and NetRole.
2. Decide whether the feature needs an RPC, a replicated property, or both. Consult [rpcs](references/rpcs.md) and [actor-replication](references/actor-replication.md).
3. If the feature is part of match rules or player lifecycle, read [game-mode](references/game-mode.md).
4. If the feature involves a player-controlled actor, read [player-ownership](references/player-ownership.md).
5. Guard all authority-only logic with `this.hasAuthority()` or `NetRuntime.isServer()`.

# Core Multiplayer Guidelines

- Import the engine module with `import * as ENGINE from '@gnsx/genesys.js'`.
- Import `NetRuntime` from `@gnsx/genesys.js` for runtime environment checks.
- The server is the only machine that changes game state. Clients send requests (via `@ServerRPC`) and display the result.
- Guard all state-modifying logic with `this.hasAuthority()` on actors or `NetRuntime.isServer()` for non-actor code.
- Do not read `NetRuntime` in constructors. The runtime type is set before `beginPlay` is called; guard in `beginPlay` or later.
- Enable replication on an actor by setting `this.replicated = true` in its constructor. Setting it on a client has no effect, so no server guard is needed. Do not set it after the actor is already in the world.
- Mark properties for network sync with `@ENGINE.property({ replicate: true })`. Only replicated actors synchronise their replicated properties.
- Use `@ServerRPC` when a client needs the server to perform an action (e.g., fire a weapon, request a respawn).
- Use `@ClientRPC` when the server needs to notify the owning client of something (e.g., display a UI prompt).
- Use `@MulticastRPC` for events that every client must see simultaneously (e.g., an explosion visual).
- GameMode methods only execute on the server. Do not call them from client-side code.
- All actors are server-authoritative, including PlayerController and its Pawn. The controlling client has the AutonomousProxy role for its own controller and pawn, which allows local movement prediction. The server validates those actions and replicates the authoritative result back; the client corrects if there is a discrepancy.

# Tips

- When in doubt about where code runs, add a temporary `console.log(NetRuntime.getType())` to verify.
- Replicated property updates flow from server to clients only. A client writing to a replicated property has no network effect.
- `@ServerRPC` methods execute directly when called with authority on the server. Wrap the call site in `if (NetRuntime.isClient())` if the server shouldn't trigger the method.
- Consult the engine source under `.engine/` for exact method signatures before writing RPC or replication code.
