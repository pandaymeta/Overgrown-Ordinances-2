# Behavior Tree Overview

## How the system fits together

`BehaviorTreeNode` sits on an NPC placeable and runs a behavior tree each `tickInterval` seconds (prefer `tickInterval`; `updateInterval` is a deprecated alias only). Before each run it calls `blackboard.updateGameState()` so nodes can read fresh owner and player data.

The tree is a hierarchy of **nodes**. **Composite** nodes (`Sequence`, `Selector`) have children and delegate execution. **Leaf** nodes are **actions** — they perform gameplay (pathfinding, combat, waiting). **Conditions** gate whether a node may run; they attach to a node via `conditions: [...]` and are checked before that node's logic.

When the root returns `Success` or `Failure`, the node resets the tree and will run it again on the next tick. Design long-running NPC behavior as a root `Selector` whose branches cover fight, flee, patrol, idle, etc.

## Node semantics

| Node | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Sequence** | Children left to right. Fails on first child failure. Succeeds when every child succeeds. Stays `Running` while a child runs. |
| **Selector** | Children top to bottom by priority. Succeeds on first child success. Fails when every child fails. Stays `Running` while a child runs. |

Every node execution yields `Success`, `Failure`, or `Running` (see `BehaviorNode.ts`).

## Blackboard

The blackboard is a per-node key/value store. Actions write outputs (e.g. next waypoint); conditions and sibling actions read them. The owner is available via `blackboard.getOwner()`. Auto-updated keys (player position, distance, etc.) are populated in `Blackboard.updateGameState()` — read that file for the current list.

## Authoring

- **Programmatic** — build `SequenceNode` / `SelectorNode` trees in code, pass as `rootNode` on the node.
- **JSON** — asset referenced by `behaviorTreePath`; types and options map to entries in `BehaviorTreeLoader` registries.
- **Custom nodes** — built-ins are a starting point; extend `BehaviorAction` or `ConditionEvaluator` for game-specific behavior, then register types with `BehaviorTreeLoader` if you use JSON. See `BehaviorAction.ts`, `ConditionEvaluator.ts`, and `BehaviorTreeLoader.ts`.

NPC pawns need movement and combat nodes that match the actions you use (e.g. `NpcMovementNode` for ground pathing, `AerialMovementNode` for flying). Node requirements are enforced in each action's source file.
